# The Opioid Crisis: Analyzing Prescription Drug Use and Overdose Trends

## Overview
This project explores trends in opioid prescriptions, overdose deaths, and related policies in the United States. By analyzing structured datasets from various sources, we aim to understand how opioid usage has evolved over time, how policy changes have influenced trends, and whether funding allocations impact overdose rates.

## Research Questions
- How have opioid prescriptions changed over time? How do they vary by state?
- How do overdose deaths differ across states?
- What impact have opioid prescription restrictions had on usage and overdose rates?
- Is there a relationship between addiction treatment funding and overdose deaths?
- How does the proportion of U.S. overdose deaths compare to other countries?

## Data Sources
1. Opioid Dispensing Rate Maps | CDC
   - Description: State-level opioid dispensing rates from 2019-2023.
3. Opioid Settlement Expenditures

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine trends, distributions, and missing data.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Assess variations in opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths across states and over time.
- **Policy Impact Assessment**: Identify correlations between policy changes and opioid-related outcomes.
- **Funding Analysis**: Evaluate how addiction treatment funding correlates with overdose rates.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Map opioid dispensing rates and overdose deaths across states.
